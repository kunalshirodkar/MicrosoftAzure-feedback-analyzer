## 🎯 Purpose & Use Case  

Retail and e-commerce stores often collect customer feedback but struggle to analyze it efficiently.  
This project automates that process by using **Azure Cognitive Services** to classify sentiments as *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*.

🛍️ **Use Case Example:**  
- A product store embeds this feedback form on their website.  
- Customers submit feedback about products.  
- The app stores each response in **Cosmos DB** and instantly runs **sentiment analysis** using Azure AI.  
- Store managers can then track patterns (e.g., “too small size,” “great fit,” “bad color options”) and take **data-driven actions** to improve product quality and customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Users submit feedback through a simple form built with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.  
Data is sent to a **Node.js backend**, stored in **Azure Cosmos DB**, and analyzed via **Azure Cognitive Services (Text Analytics API)**.  
The processed sentiment results are displayed on the console and stored for visualization or reporting.
